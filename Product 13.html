<p>Greenlight was founded in 2002 by Kevin Davey, originating from sporting-goods companies Davey Sports Management Inc. and Radius Group Inc. The company initially sold sports-oriented goods and IndyCar replicas. Later it took a turn to producing diecast toy cars and replicas. It was acquired by Russell Hughes, Tom van der Scheun and Fred Lo in 2013. Hughes focused on obtaining a license from movies and TV-shows to produce vehicles associated with them. The brand already had a successful experience in 2010 of selling replicas of Ford Mustang featured in the film Bullitt. The company saw substantial revenue growth since then, reaching $12.5 million in 2015 and tripling the revenue of 2013.[3]</p>
