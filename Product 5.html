<p>Tomy Co. of Japan was founded in 1924 by Eijira Tomiyama in Tokyo.[3] The company has produced a variety of toys, but in 1970 started production of the Tomica line of diecast vehicles as a result of the surge of interest in the global market in toy cars which was led mainly by Matchbox and Hot Wheels.[2] Although models of various scales have been made, the name "Tomica" normally refers to the 3-inch sized mainstream vehicles most commonly produced by the company. Originally, the name "Pocket Cars" was given to Tomicas sold in the 1970s in the United States. After four decades, Tomy Corporation again entered the North American and European markets with the Tomica name in 2010.</p>
