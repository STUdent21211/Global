<p>Bburago is a manufacturing company of toys and die-cast scale model cars formerly based in Italy. The company was based in Burago di Molgora, where all products were made from 1974 to 2005. At the height of its popularity, Bburago's main competitors were Politoys and Maisto, the latter of which was to become dominant in the 1:18 market segment around 2000. In 2006, Hong Kong-based May Cheong Group (owner of the Maisto and later Polistil brands) acquired rights to the "Bburago" brand, taking over the manufacturing operations, which were then shifted to China.</p>
